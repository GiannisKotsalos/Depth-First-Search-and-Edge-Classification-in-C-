Features:

1.DFS Traversal: The program performs a depth-first search on a directed graph.

2.Edge Classification: Edges are classified into tree, back, forward, and cross types during the traversal.

3.Graph Representation: The graph is represented using adjacency lists, providing a clear view of the connections between vertices.

How to Use:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler.

3.Modify the main function to input your own graph or use the provided example.

Explore the code to understand and visualize the classifications of edges in a directed graph.
